# Stock_Price_Prediction
 
The Data Science Stock Price Prediction Model using LSTM  is an advanced machine learning model that uses historical stock data to predict future prices. The model utilizes a recurrent neural network architecture to analyze and interpret patterns in the stock data, and the LSTM layer helps the model capture long-term dependencies in the data. The model can predict future stock prices with high accuracy and can be used by investors to make informed decisions about their investments. The project involves preprocessing the data, training the LSTM model, and evaluating its performance. The results of this project can assist investors in making informed decisions about their investments.
